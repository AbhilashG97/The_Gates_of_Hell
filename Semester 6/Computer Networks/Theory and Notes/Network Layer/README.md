# Network Layer

## Introduction 

> A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication between application processes running on different host.

The application processes can be present in different parts of the world and the information that the two processes send to each other are sent through the transport layer which ensures that the data is reached to the other end.


:warning: The transport layer protocols are implemented in the end systems, but not in network routers.
