# NLP Lecture Notes - DAY THREE

## Why is NLP hard?

NLP is hard because of the following reasons - 

1.  **Lexical Ambiguity**

    In this case the same word will have multiple meanings. Here is an example - 

    ```Will Will will Will's will?``` 

    Each of the word ```will``` has the following meanings which are given below - 

    1. Modal verb (should, would, can) 

    1. Noun (Name of a person)

    1. verb

    1. Name of a preson, this name can be of the same person, or could be of a different person.

    1. Noun

    In the above sentence the same word has different meanings. 

    Here is an another example - 

    ```Rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses.``` 

    The word ```rose``` has the following meaning - 

    1. Name of the person

    1. Verb (past tense of the word rise)

    1. The third rose is used as an adjective (it denotes the color red)

    1. Roes is a seafood which is red in color.

    1. The last word rose refers to flower rose.

    Here is another extreme case of lexical ambiguity - 

    ```Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo biffalo Buffalo buffalo.```

    The above sentence is comprised of the word ```buffalo```, which is used 8 times.

    The word buffalo that is used the above sentence has the following meaning -

    1. The animal - buffalo

    1. A city in US - Buffalo

    1. A verb - which means to bully someone

:warning: In the sentences given above, we can notice that the same word has different meanings, this is called lexical ambiguity.

1.  **Language Ambiguity: Structural**

    In this case, the same sentence can have different meanings. 

    Here is an example - 

    ```The man saw the boy with the binoculors.```

    The above sentence can have two meanings - 

    1. A man is seeing a boy through the binoculors

    1. The man is seeing a boy who has binoculors.

    Here is an another example - 

    ```Flyihg planes can be dangerous.```

    In the above sentence it is not clear whether it is the flying planes that are dangerous or is it the act of flying 
    the plane that is dangerous.

    Here is an another example - 

    ```Hole found in the room wall; police are looking into it.```

    Again, in the above sentence it ambigous whether the police are looking through the hole found in the room or are they 
    investigating the presence of the hole in the room.  

## A few important points about ambiguity in a language 

:warning: Ambiguity is the primary difference between natural language and compiler languages.

:warning: Formal programming languages are designed to be unambigious. 

Formal programming languages can be defined by a grammar that produces a unique parse for each sentence in the language. 

Programming languages are designed in a way that allows easy parsing.

:warning: Non-standard use of english also makes NLP hard to understand. 

:exclamation: Often in NLP it is difficult to find out where to segment the words in a sentence. 

:warning: Idioms present in a language also make NLP hard. 

## Tools required in NLP

1. Knowledge about the language

1. Knowledge about the world

1. A way to combine knowledge resources.
